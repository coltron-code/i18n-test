# Premium Auctions

After _any_ .eth name has been released, it goes into a Premium Dutch auction for 28 days. There is a linear price decay until the name is bought within the premium window or the premium auction ends, resulting in the name being able to be registered without any premium.

**Important:** Registering a .eth name while it is in the premium window will require the premium fee, plus the yearly registration fee, as well as gas to transact on the Ethereum blockchain.
