* **Your wallet address ➞ Your ENS name,** or for a practical example: **0xa19A7ae868eDe64C6C5256A64BCD3bf3a9F2d615 ➞ cthulu.eth** _Determined by the Primary (reverse) record set in your wallet._

In order to set an ENS name as Primary in a wallet, it's therefore a requirement that the ENS name first resolves to that wallet address.

In order to set your ENS name as Primary in your wallet:

1. Make sure the ETH-Address record points to the wallet address
2. Connect your wallet to the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains) and set the ENS name as Primary.
