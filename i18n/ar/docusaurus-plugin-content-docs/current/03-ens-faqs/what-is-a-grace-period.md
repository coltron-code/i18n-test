# What is a grace period?

The **grace period** is the 90-day time-frame that is given after an ENS name expires. During this time the name cannot be transferred to a new Registrant (owner) and the records cannot be updated. The ENS name must first be renewed so that it leaves the grace period and has an expiration date into the future.

If the ENS name is not renewed before the grace period ends, the name will enter a premium Dutch auction for 21-days. At the end of 21 days the ENS name will not have a premium attached any longer and can be registered at the standard yearly fee. The premium auction currently starts at $100,000,000 USD and decreases with a non-linear decay over 21-days. If the name is purchased during the premium period, the purchaser will pay the premium auction price and the standard yearly fee.
