# Renewals

All .eth names expire, but can be renewed. Renewal fees are currently set to the same costs as the registration fees.

* 5+ character .eth names: $5 in ETH per year.
* 4 character .eth names: $160 in ETH per year.
* 3 character .eth names $640 in ETH per year.

**Note:** Any wallet can renew an ENS name. The wallet does not need to own the name in order to extend the registration period.
